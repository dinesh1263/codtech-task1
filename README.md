## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT "Calculator"

This project is a simple yet powerful calculator built using Python and the Tkinter library. The calculator offers basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with advanced operations like exponentiation and modulus.

### Features:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The calculator provides a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy to perform calculations.
- **Basic Operations**: Includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Operations**: Supports exponentiation (`^`) and modulus (`%`) operations.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents division by zero with appropriate error messages.
- **Clear Functionality**: Users can clear the entire input or delete the last entered character.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout automatically adjusts to different window sizes.

### Key Activities:
- **GUI Design**: Developed a user interface using Tkinter with a focus on responsiveness and usability.
- **Core Functionality Implementation**: Integrated basic and advanced arithmetic operations into the calculator.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented mechanisms to handle common errors, such as division by zero.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Conducted thorough testing to ensure the application runs smoothly without bugs.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language used for developing the application.
- **Tkinter**: Python’s standard GUI toolkit, used to create the user interface.
- **Git**: Version control system for managing the project’s codebase.

### Key Insights:
- **GUI Development**: Learned the importance of creating a user-friendly and responsive interface.
- **Error Management**: Gained insights into handling exceptions gracefully to prevent application crashes.
- **Modular Code Design**: Emphasized the value of writing modular and reusable code, which enhances maintainability.
- **Version Control**: Recognized the importance of using version control to track changes and collaborate efficiently.

### How to Use:
1. **Numeric Input**: Click on the numeric buttons to input values.
2. **Operations**: Use the `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, and `%` buttons for operations.
3. **Result Calculation**: Press the `=` button to compute the result.
4. **Clear Input**: Use the `C` button to clear the entire input or `CE` to delete the last character.
5. **Exit**: Close the window to exit the calculator.

### Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- **Tkinter Library**: Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so no additional installations are required.
